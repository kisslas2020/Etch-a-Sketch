# Etch-a-Sketch

There is a starting page with 16 x 16 grid.

There is a 'Clear' button, that clears the sheet and asks the user to give the size of the grid. After this an empty grid arrears with the given size.

There are three radio buttons that determine the color of the sketch. Default is black and white.
